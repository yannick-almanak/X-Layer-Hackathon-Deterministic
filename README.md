# X-Layer Deterministic Strategy: Aave-Uniswap CLMM Yield Loop

> **X-Layer Build-X Hackathon submission** — Project #2: Deterministic DeFi
> _Season: April 1-15, 2026_

A production-grade **supply -> borrow -> CLMM yield** strategy that
chains **Aave V3.6 + Uniswap V3** into a multi-protocol yield loop on
X-Layer. The strategy supplies stablecoin collateral, borrows against
it, and deploys the borrowed capital into a concentrated LP position
to earn trading fees that exceed the borrow cost.

> **Built with two Almanak products:**
>
> - **[Almanak SDK](https://github.com/almanak-co/sdk)** (open-source) —
>   a production DeFi strategy framework for quants. Intent-based
>   vocabulary, multi-chain / multi-protocol connectors, gateway-mediated
>   execution, and built-in backtesting. The SDK **recently added
>   X-Layer support**, including the Aave V3.6 and Uniswap V3 connectors
>   used here. This strategy is a live example of what a single
>   `IntentStrategy` class can do across those two protocols on X-Layer.
>
> - **Almanak Edge** (not open-source, freemium) — Almanak's DeFi alpha
>   signal finder. Edge pulls on-chain activity via the **OKX Onchain OS
>   API** to surface high-conviction opportunities across chains
>   (including X-Layer). The original idea for this strategy came from
>   an Edge signal (`cmnt8k6v2005saopppn2hx9bx`) that flagged the
>   Aave + Uniswap V3 edge on X-Layer.

## Why this strategy

This strategy **showcases what the Almanak SDK can do on X-Layer**:
multi-protocol composition (Aave V3.6 + Uniswap V3), adaptive
vol-based rebalancing, full entry→monitor→teardown lifecycle, and
real on-chain execution driven by a single `IntentStrategy` class. It
demonstrates how quickly a quant can wire up a production DeFi loop
using the SDK's intent vocabulary, connector framework, and gateway
execution pipeline — all on a fresh chain (X-Layer / OKB L2).

**Honest take on current X-Layer economics (April 2026):** right now
the Aave V3.6 supply/borrow leg is a net drag — borrow rates exceed
supply yield by a comfortable margin on the reserves we use, so
economically it would be *better today* to skip the lending leg
entirely and just run a straight Uniswap V3 WOKB/USDT LP. We kept the
full carry loop in because:

1. It exercises the SDK's full multi-protocol surface (the actual
   *point* of the hackathon submission — show what the stack can do).
2. As X-Layer matures and lending pools deepen, supply rates will
   catch up and the carry will turn positive — at which point the
   strategy is already built and parameterized.
3. The adaptive-range LP component is the dominant profit center
   regardless of the lending leg; the loop just adds modest extra
   leverage when the spread is favorable.

In other words: this is an **infrastructure showcase first, yield
optimizer second**. When X-Layer Aave rates normalize, the same
strategy will make a small extra gain on the carry spread on top of
LP fees.

## Strategy: `aave_okb_clmm_loop`

See `aave_okb_clmm_loop/README.md` for the full 790-line technical
documentation including architecture, economics, backtesting results,
risk analysis, and IL mechanics.

**Quick summary:**

```
Supply USDT0 to Aave V3.6
  -> Borrow USDG at 50% LTV (HF ~1.5)
  -> Convert USDG -> USDT (stablecoin hop)
  -> Split half USDT -> WOKB
  -> Open Uniswap V3 WOKB/USDT/3000 concentrated LP
  -> Monitor + auto-rebalance with vol-adaptive range
```

## Proven on mainnet (full lifecycle: entry -> earn -> teardown)

This strategy was deployed on xlayer mainnet from April 11-13, 2026.
After 88 hours of live operation earning 17% APR in LP fees, it was
torn down via the built-in teardown mechanism to demonstrate the full
lifecycle. **Every transaction below is verifiable on the
[OKX X-Layer Explorer](https://www.okx.com/web3/explorer/xlayer).**

### On-chain P&L (honest accounting)

```
INCOME
  LP fees earned (on-chain):            +$0.005319
  Aave supply interest:                 +$0.000007
                                        ──────────
  Total income:                         +$0.005326

COSTS
  Borrow interest (88h, 1.5% APR):     -$0.000302
  Entry swap slippage (2 swaps):        -$0.001599
  Teardown swap slippage (2 swaps):     -$0.016599
  Gas — entry (8 txs):                  -$0.004500
  Gas — teardown (9 txs):              -$0.004500
                                        ──────────
  Total costs:                          -$0.027500

NET P&L:                                -$0.022174  (-0.55% on $4.00)
```

**The strategy lost $0.022 on a $4.00 position over 3.7 days.**

The LP fee income ($0.0053, tracking 17% APR) was real and verifiable
on-chain. But the one-time round-trip costs (swap slippage + gas =
$0.027) exceeded the fee income because:

1. **$4 is too small.** Swap fees and gas are fixed costs that don't
   scale with position size. At $4, the ~$0.027 round-trip overhead
   is 0.68% of capital -- a steep hurdle to clear in 3.7 days.

2. **3.7 days is too short.** The 17% fee APR needs time to compound
   past the entry+exit costs.

### Breakeven analysis

| Capital | Round-trip cost | Daily fee income | Breakeven time |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| $4 | $0.027 | $0.0014 | **~19 days** |
| $50 | $0.027 | $0.017 | **~1.6 days** |
| **$200** | **$0.027** | **$0.069** | **~9 hours** |
| $1,000 | $0.027 | $0.345 | **~2 hours** |

The strategy is profitable at any capital level -- it just needs
enough time for fee accumulation to exceed the fixed entry+exit cost.
At $200 (the planned redeployment), breakeven is ~9 hours.

### Redeployment plan

The strategy will be redeployed on a **dedicated isolated wallet** with
**$200 USD** of capital ($200 USDT0 supply -> $100 USDG borrow -> LP).

At $200:
- Expected fee income: ~$0.069/day (~$2.07/month)
- Expected costs: $0.027 entry + $0.0002/day borrow = $0.033 first month
- **Expected net profit after 1 month: ~$2.04 (+1.0%)**
- **Annualized at 17% fee APR: ~$27/year net (+13.5% APR after all costs)**

## How to run

almanak strat run \
    -d strategies/xlayer/xlayer_deterministic/aave_okb_clmm_loop \
    --network mainnet --interval 30 --fresh

# Teardown (set force_teardown=true in config.json, then run)
almanak strat run \
    -d strategies/xlayer/xlayer_deterministic/aave_okb_clmm_loop \
    --network mainnet --interval 10

## Key features

1. **Multi-protocol composition**: Aave V3.6 + Uniswap V3 in a single
   coordinated lifecycle — not just a swap or a deposit, but a genuine
   cross-protocol yield strategy

2. **Adaptive auto-rebalance**: vol-scaled range width, 10-cycle spike
   confirmation, 1-hour cooldown. The strategy survives volatile
   markets without rebalancing itself to death

3. **Full lifecycle management**: entry pipeline (7 intents), steady-
   state monitoring, teardown (7 intents). Every state transition is
   tested on mainnet

4. **Custom backtesting engine**: 90-day historical simulation with
   63-configuration parameter sweep. Best config: +106% APR over the
   test period

5. **Comprehensive risk documentation**: IL mechanics, 5 risk
   categories, 5 mitigation strategies, vol-regime return projections
